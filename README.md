Kinect Across
=============

Hackathon project to explore sending 3D data across a WebRTC data channel so that both sides can explore the data in VR.

Includes a hacked apart version of https://github.com/jawj/websocket-kinect to access kinect depth data through websockets.

The VR webapp is built starting https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate.
